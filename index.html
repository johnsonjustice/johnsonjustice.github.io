        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a highly motivated and dedicated first-year college student with a strong background in customer service. Throughout my academic journey and professional experiences, I have developed essential skills and qualities that make me a valuable asset in any customer-facing role. Currently, I am enrolled as a first-year student at UCR, pursuing a degree in Business Administration. I have always possessed a thirst for knowledge and a passion for learning, which drove me to excel academically. In high school, I maintained a stellar academic record, consistently earning top grades in subjects such as AP Calculus . These courses not only expanded my knowledge but also sharpened my critical thinking and problem-solving skills.<br><br>

        I have had the privilege of working in customer service for the past three years, which has provided me with invaluable hands-on experience. My first role was as a cashier/customer service representative at Yoshinoya, where I assisted customers with inquiries, learned cashiering, and resolved any issues or concerns customers had. During my time there, I honed my communication and interpersonal skills, learning how to effectively communicate with customers and provide exceptional service.
I thrived in this role, as I enjoyed guiding and mentoring my colleagues to deliver outstanding customer experiences. In my most recent position as a certified training manager at Wingstop, I further enhanced my customer service skills by handling escalated customer issues and managing complex situations. I learned how to remain calm under pressure and find effective solutions to satisfy both the customers and the company's interests. Additionally, I consistently exceeded performance targets and received recognition for my exceptional customer service skills.<br><br>

        Throughout my customer service experiences, I have developed several transferable skills that are applicable beyond the realm of customer service. These include: Effective Communication: I excel in verbal and written communication, allowing me to clearly convey information and build rapport with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Problem-Solving: I have a strong analytical mindset and the ability to identify and implement solutions to challenges efficiently. Adaptability: I thrive in dynamic and fast-paced environments, readily adapting to changes and effectively managing priorities. Empathy and Patience: I understand the importance of empathy and maintaining a patient demeanor, allowing me to approach difficult situations with understanding and compassion. Teamwork: Working collaboratively with diverse teams has taught me the value of cooperation, compromise, and shared goals. Beyond my educational and professional endeavors, I actively seek personal growth and development opportunities. I engage in various extracurricular activities which allow me to expand my horizons, develop leadership skills, and make a positive impact in my community. Looking to the future, I am excited to combine my academic pursuits with my customer service experience to achieve success in my chosen field. I plan to leverage my strong foundation in customer service to contribute effectively in roles that prioritize customer satisfaction and quality service delivery.
In conclusion, my dedication to academic excellence and my years of customer service experience have prepared me to excel in my college journey and beyond. I am confident that my transferable skills, strong work ethic, and passion for providing exceptional customer experiences will make me an asset in any professional environment. I look forward to joining a team where I can contribute, learn, and grow while striving to make a positive impact.
